<p>Thank you for visiting my website. Here's some information about my hobbies and interests.</p>

<h2>Swim</h2>
<p>I'm a member of <b>Bentley University's</b> <i>NCAA DII Swim team</i>. I've been training and competing for over a decade and specialize in Sprint Freestyle. You can see my times on <a href ="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/1167303/">SwimCloud!</a></p>

<p>My favorite race of all time is Jason Lezak's comeback against France in the 4x100 Freestyle relay at the Beijing Olympics. You can watch that here:</p>

    "We play a lot of Nintendo games, a lot of Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, a few different card games, really just stuff so we can stay loose and get your mind off of swimming before going into the meet with full focus." -Caeleb Dressel

<h2>Coaching</h2>
<p>In the summers I'm a private swim instructor. I teach children and adults basic swim lessons, and for adults I also instruct swimming as a form of personal training.</p>

<h2>Finance</h2>
<p>I'm majoring in Finance, and am thoroughly interested in concepts involving asset valuation, budgeting, and portfolio management.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>
<p>Although Java programming began as a hobby of mine, college gave me the opportunity to expand my interest into a Minor, where I'm learning other languages and applications of computer coding.</p>

<h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
<p>As for my interests, I enjoy a variety of strategy games such as:</p>

<li>Pokemon</li>
<li>Magic: The Gathering</li>
<li>Chess</li>
<li>Super Smash Bros</li>
<li>Clash of Clans</li>
