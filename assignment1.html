<h1>Welcome to my Website! I'm Tyler</h1>
<p>Thank you for visiting my website. Here's some information about my hobbies and interests.</p>

<h2>Swim</h2>
<p>I'm a member of <b>Bentley University's</b> <i>NCAA DII Swim team</i>. I've been training and competing for over a decade and specialize in Sprint Freestyle. You can see my times on <a href ="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/1167303/">SwimCloud!</a></p>

    "We play a lot of Nintendo games, a lot of Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, a few different card games, really just stuff so we can stay loose and get your mind off of swimming before going into the meet with full focus." -Caeleb Dressel

<h2>Coaching</h2>
<p>In the summers I'm a private swim instructor. I teach children and adults basic swim lessons, and for adults I also instruct swimming as a form of personal training.</p>
